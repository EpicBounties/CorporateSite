When it comes to security teams, one of the highest priorities is to reduce risk. An important part of risk reduction is the creation of a cybersecurity risk management strategy.

As the world becomes more dependent on digital technology, risk management is becoming a more central part of every organization's operations. 

Unethical hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making risk management crucial to every organization's duties to customers and stakeholders. 

One element of any risk management strategy is knowledge of potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for unethical hackers to access your systems. 

We all have a role to play in reducing security risks. We all have the power to unintentionally provoke an incident. Here are three common ways organizations get hacked and how we can prevent them. 

###### Do not reuse passwords on multiple websites.  

Adding simple numbers or symbols to the end of a password does not count as a new password.

###### Contain the company's assets in the company's systems.  

By searching sites like GitHub and Pastebin, your credentials can be found by unethical hackers. 

###### Watch out for subdomain acquisitions 

Always disable DNS before disabling a service and have that service checked regularly. 

As with all things in the world of cybersecurity, there are no guarantees. Just as no car insurance can guarantee that you won't get into a car accident, no organization can completely eliminate all vulnerabilities in your system or block all cyberattacks.   

Cybersecurity risk management helps organizations address the risks that have the greatest potential impact on their operations. The better your information about the threats most likely to affect your organization and the vulnerabilities that exist in your infrastructure, the better you can reduce risk and optimize outcomes in the event of a security incident.
