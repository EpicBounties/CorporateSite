Bug bounty programs are a pay-for-performance approach to proactive security testing designed to maximize the discovery of high-impact vulnerabilities in organizations. 

Through bug bounty programs, organizations have access to thousands of highly skilled security researchers ready to help organizations find vulnerabilities that other tools miss.

The community is so extensive that you can find talent available 24/7, with release timelines that blow traditional vulnerability research models out of the water. Platform-driven solutions also include 24/7 vulnerability visibility and reporting, high-level researcher management, and seamless business process integration with your development team's favorite vulnerability management and ticketing solutions.

We share with you the most outstanding benefits:  

###### SHARED ACCESS TO THE BEST TALENT   

The Epic Bounties model allows all participants to share in the value of something impossible to replicate alone. Rewards for mistakes provide an elastic workforce when you need it, not when you don't.

###### QUICK LAUNCH AND TIME TO VALUE

A global network of hundreds of thousands of hunters operating on a pay-to-find vulnerability model drastically reduces time to launch. A competitive layer of first-to-find incentive also accelerates the time to find truly impactful bugs.

###### ONGOING MONITORING

Not paying per head or per hour means you can afford to have a testing practice that fits today's agile development cycles. Attackers don't take a day off, so why should your security program?

###### UNIQUE SKILLS ON DEMAND

It has a large in-house team, but is no match for a global team of investigators. Epic Bounties offers the largest roster of vetted, ranked and highly active investigators with infinite combinations of skills and experience.

###### RAPID RISK REDUCTION

Competitive, incentive-based testing motivates hunters to think creatively and find the high-impact vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to the business.

###### LOWER OPERATIONAL BURDEN

No software or virtual appliances to install. Bug bounty providers are cloud-based and integrate directly into your existing SDLC. Managed solutions also reduce resource leakage through triage and prioritization.

###### BEST VALUE FOR MONEY

A results-oriented model means that you only pay for valid vulnerabilities, not for the time or effort it took to find them. High-impact vulnerabilities are rewarded more than those classified as less serious.

###### BEST VALUE FOR MONEY

Modern bug bounty providers allow you to see vulnerabilities in real time directly on the platform. See and fix your biggest threats today, not weeks later as with traditional testing methods.
