<b>Trends within bug bounty programs</b> continue to rise, so it is important to be updated to any changes or modifications around this program.

The importance of cybersecurity increased in 2020 driven by telecommuting and the recent digital transformation of enterprises.

In today's article you will understand the main key industry and vulnerability trends in order to stay updated in our day-to-day.

## Industry update 

Currently, it is estimated that there are 2.7 million unfilled positions in the cybersecurity industry, data suggests that organisations are increasingly turning to a combination of data-driven insights, technology and human intelligence to more efficiently address the critical errors that have been caused by the digital transformation process.

## Key industry trends

#### Government Fast Track for the adoption of these programmes 

Global lockdown caused people to spend much more time in front of screens, and new vulnerabilities were identified as a result of this change in global habits.

In this case, governments have decided to include in their budgets actions against this type of cyber attacks, such as, for example, <i>the White House</i>, which has commissioned the creation of new manuals for responding to vulnerabilities and security incidents.

####  Increased incentives in software 

In the software sector, a benchmark in the cybersecurity ecosystem as a whole, spending increased by 73%. The digital transformation brought about by the pandemic led to a historic increase that has been sustained during this time.

However, the most drastic change has been in the discovery of hidden vulnerabilities, especially in the most critical ones, which led to a high incentive for people to solve these types of problems.

#### Security in the financial sector 

Companies in the financial sector were forced to provide their services online during the confinement in 2020 to maintain their daily operations, this accelerated the digital transformation and the importance of cybersecurity to avoid any cyber attack that could happen.

## Key vulnerability trends

Cloud misconfiguration is one of the most common cloud security risks. This common occurrence can even lead to financial risks for the company. 

Because cloud misconfiguration is one of the most common risks in enterprises, it is the one we need to be on top of the most to ensure that the cloud infrastructure is secure for the enterprise. To do this, we must detect and fix security vulnerabilities as early as possible so that the attacker does no more damage to the company.

#### The democratisation of threats

Cybersecurity breaches made numerous headlines in 2021, with several high-profile incidents creating some fear in society due to emerging threats such as <i>Ransomware</i>. As a result, countries decided to intervene forcefully in the face of recent attacks.

#### The advent of Ransomware

Ransomware overtook personal data breaches as the top threat in cybersecurity news around the world in 2021. During the first half of 2021, financial crime reached $590 million in the US alone, up from $416 million in 2020.

Ransomware attacks currently prevent users from accessing their system or personal files and demand a ransom to be paid in order to regain access. These attacks include detailed research to identify targets, advanced communications and media relations to stoke fear and increase the likelihood that the victim will pay.

#### Smart Security

Due to the large amount of information that is generated daily, security is detecting more and more alerts, so it is expected that the response to this situation will involve the application of artificial intelligence to understand how a threat can affect our company. We must bear in mind that the main security threats are still unknown. Such intelligence will be needed to detect unknown anomalies, which we do not know where they come from.

#### Vulnerable Internet of Things

By 2022, the number of connected devices will exceed 18 billion, so there will be a greater number of potential access points to systems for cybercriminals.

Many organisations are already working to develop digital twins, which are digital simulations of complete systems. Such models are connected to operating systems in such a way that they manage the data collected by them.

Edge computing devices, where data is operated as close as possible to the point where it is collected, as well as centralised cloud infrastructure, are targeted by cybercriminals.
